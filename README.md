A simple timer built with redux-saga.

To run the app, just open ```index.html```.

If you want to play around with the code, follow these instructions:

1. If you haven't already installed Webpack, run: ```npm install -g webpack```
2. Install all required node modules with: ```npm install```
3. And finally start Webpack with: ```webpack -w```. The ```-w``` argument tells Webpack to listen on file change and update the bundle.
